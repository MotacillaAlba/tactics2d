## About

`tactics2d` is an open-source Python library that provides diverse and challenging traffic scenarios for the development and evaluation of reinforcement learning-based decision-making models in autonomous driving. `tactics2d` stands out with the following key features:

- **Compatibility**
  - üì¶ Trajectory dataset -- Enables seamless importation of various real-world trajectory datasets, including Argoverse, Dragon Lake Parking (DLP), INTERACTION, LevelX Series (highD, inD, rounD, ExiD), NuPlan, and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), encompassing both trajectory parsing and map information.
  - üìÑ Map format -- Enables parsing and conversion of commonly used open map formats like OpenDRIVE, Lanelet2-style OpenStreetMap (OSM), and SUMO roadnet.
- **Customizability**
  - üöó Traffic participants -- Supports the creation of new traffic participant classes with customizable physical attributes, physics dynamics/kinematics models, and behavior models.
  - üöß Road elements -- Support the definition of new road elements, with a focus on regulatory aspects.
- **Diversity**
  - üõ£Ô∏è Traffic scenarios -- Features an extensive range of built-in Gym-style traffic scenarios, including highway, lane-merging, unsignalized/signalized intersection, roundabout, parking, and racing.
  - üö≤ Traffic participants -- Features a variety of built-in traffic participants with realistic physics parameters, detailed further [here](https://tactics2d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/participant/#templates-for-traffic-participants).
  - üì∑ Sensors -- Provides bird-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation RGB image and single-line LiDAR point cloud for model input.
- **Visualization** -- Offers a user-friendly visualization tool for real-time rendering of traffic scenarios and participants, along with the capability to record and replay traffic scenarios.
- **Reliability** -- Over [FILL LATER]\% code is covered by unit tests and integration tests.

### Install from PyPI

You can simply install `tactics2d` from PyPI with the following command.

```shell
pip install tactics2d
```

### Install from Github

You can also install `tactics2d` from from its source on GitHub. This way is recommended if you want to run the sample code or contribute to the development of `tactics2d`.

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:WoodOxen/tactics2d.git
cd tactics2d

conda create -n tactics2d python=3.8
# if you are a developer, you can install the development dependencies by
pip install -e .
# if you are a user, you can install tactics2d by
pip install .

# test the installation by
[TODO]
```

If no errors occurs, you should have installed `tactics2d` successfully.
